# Sprint-4-project
Project Overview
Welcome to the Car Database Analysis Project! This project explores a comprehensive dataset of vehicles with various specifications. Below is a brief guide to help you navigate through the project's components:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Statistical Data Analysis (SDA):

All the exploratory and statistical analysis of the data are documented in the Jupyter notebook named EDA.ipynb, located in the notebooks folder.
Streamlit Application:

The app, app.py, can be found in the scripts folder. This app allows users to filter and explore the car data interactively, offering various visualizations to help you find a vehicle that suits your budget and preferences.

Filtering and Visualization:

In the app, you can filter the dataframe based on criteria such as the car's condition, fuel type, model year, number of cylinders, and whether it has four-wheel drive. The visualizations included in the app provide insights to assist in making informed decisions.

Dependencies:

All required packages for this project are listed in the requirements.txt file located in the root directory of the project.
