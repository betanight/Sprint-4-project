# Sprint-4-project
Hello! This project focuses on a large database of cars with multiple different specifications. Here is a little guide on how you can look into the project. You will find all of the EDA and SDA in my Jupyter notebook for this project, which is found in the notebooks folder and it is labled as "EDA.ipynb". Next, to look at everything to do with the app you will need to go to the file called app.py, which is found in the scripts folder. 

This app is used to filter and find the car you are looking for, coming with different visualizations that can help you find the car that works best with your budget. In the dataframe section you can filter out the visible dataframe by adding in your needs for the car, such as its condition, fuel type, model year, the number of cylinders it has, and if it has four wheel drive or not. 

The packages imported are found in the requirements.txt file in the home of this project.
